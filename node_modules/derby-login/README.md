# Derby-Login

- Auth module for Derby 0.6
- Email/Password and [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) OAuth providers
- Uses projections (data stored in one collection)
- All routes start with '/auth/*'
- Bootstrap 3 components (change email, change password, login, logout, recover password, register, reset password)
- Custom components (forms) are supported by parse-request hooks
- Routes for confirmation of registration and email change
- Hooks (sending emails, parse-request, request, response, error)
- Bcrypt (default), Scrypt and Sha-1 encryption
- Powerful server-side API
- No jQuery dependency
- Tests
- Influenced by [derby-auth](https://github.com/lefnire/derby-auth)

## Known Issues
- Does not work with Derby 0.3 and 0.5
- No built-in access control (use [share-access](https://github.com/dmapper/share-access))
- You have only userId in '_session.userId', and you should subscribe to user in router by yourself, [example](https://github.com/derbyparty/derby-login/issues/3)

## Migration from 0.2
- set `{encryption: 'sha-1', hashField: 'passwordHash'}` in options

### Installation
```javascript
npm install derby-login
```

### Setting
#### Step 1. Require
```javascript
var derbyLogin = require('derby-login');
```
#### Step 2. Options (take a look at [default options](https://github.com/derbyparty/derby-login/blob/master/lib/defaultOptions.js))
```javascript
var options = {};
```

#### Step 3. Middleware
```javascript
  .use(derbyLogin.middleware(store, options))
```

### Example
- [derby-login-example](https://github.com/derbyparty/derby-login-example) example app with auth
