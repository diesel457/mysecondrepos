package.json(5) -- Specifics of npm's package.json handling
===========================================================

## DESCRIPTION

This document is all you need to know about what's required in your package.json
file.  It must be actual JSON, not just a JavaScript object literal.

A lot of the behavior described in this document is affected by the config
settings described in `npm-config(7)`.

## name

The *most* important things in your package.json are the name and version fields.
Those are actually required, and your package won't install without
them.  The name and version together form an identifier that is assumed
to be completely unique.  Changes to the package should come along with
changes to the version.

The name is what your thing is called.

Some rules:

* The name must be shorter than 214 characters. This includes the scope for
  scoped packages.
* The name can't start with a dot or an underscore.
* New packages must not have uppercase letters in the name.
* The name ends up being part of a URL, an argument on the command line, and a
  folder name. Therefore, the name can't contain any non-URL-safe characters.

Some tips:

* Don't use the same name as a core Node module.
* Don't put "js" or "node" in the name.  It's assumed that it's js, since you're
  writing a package.json file, and you can specify the engine using the "engines"
  field.  (See below.)
* The name will probably be passed as an argument to require(), so it should
  be something short, but also reasonably descriptive.
* You may want to check the npm registry to see if there's something by that name
  already, before you get too attached to it. <https://www.npmjs.com/>

A name can be optionally prefixed by a scope, e.g. `@myorg/mypackage`. See
`npm-scope(7)` for more detail.

## version

The *most* important things in your package.json are the name and version fields.
Those are actually required, and your package won't install without
them.  The name and version together form an identifier that is assumed
to be completely unique.  Changes to the package should come along with
changes to the version.

Version must be parseable by
[node-semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver), which is bundled
with npm as a dependency.  (`npm install semver` to use it yourself.)

More on version numbers and ranges at semver(7).

## description

Put a description in it.  It's a string.  This helps people discover your
package, as it's listed in `npm search`.

## keywords

Put keywords in it.  It's an array of strings.  This helps people
discover your package as it's listed in `npm search`.

## homepage

The url to the project homepage.

**NOTE**: This is *not* the same as "url".  If you put a "url" field,
then the registry will think it's a redirection to your package that has
been published somewhere else, and spit at you.

Literally.  Spit.  I'm so not kidding.

## bugs

The url to your project's issue tracker and / or the email address to which
issues should be reported. These are helpful for people who encounter issues
with your package.

It should look like this:

    { "url" : "https://github.com/owner/project/issues"
    , "email" : "project@hostname.com"
    }

You can specify either one or both values. If you want to provide only a url,
you can specify the value for "bugs" as a simple string instead of an object.

If a url is provided, it will be used by the `npm bugs` command.

## license

You should specify a license for your package so that people know how they are
permitted to use it, and any restrictions you're placing on it.

If you're using a common license such as BSD-2-Clause or MIT, add a
current SPDX license identifier for the license you're using, like this:

    { "license" : "BSD-3-Clause" }

You can check [the full list of SPDX license IDs](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
Ideally you should pick one that is
[OSI](http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) approved.

If your package is licensed under multiple common licenses, use an [SPDX license
expression syntax version 2.0 string](http://npmjs.com/package/spdx), like this:

    { "license" : "(ISC OR GPL-3.0)" }

If you are using a license that hasn't been assigned an SPDX identifier, or if
you are using a custom license, use the following valid SPDX expression:

    { "license" : "SEE LICENSE IN <filename>" }

Then include a file named `<filename>` at the top level of the package.

Some old packages used license objects or a "licenses" property containing an
array of license objects:

    // Not valid metadata
    { "license" :
      { "type" : "ISC"
      , "url" : "http://opensource.org/licenses/ISC"
      }
    }

    // Not valid metadata
    { "licenses" :
      [
        { "type": "MIT"
        , "url": "http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"
        }
      , { "type": "Apache-2.0"
        , "url": "http://opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php"
        }
      ]
    }

Those styles are now deprecated. Instead, use SPDX expressions, like this:

    { "license": "ISC" }

    { "license": "(MIT OR Apache-2.0)" }

Finally, if you do not wish to grant others the r
